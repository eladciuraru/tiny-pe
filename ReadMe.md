# Tiny PE
Example for building PE "manually" (using assembler as helper),
to generate small executable binaries.

This is not a partical way to generate small PE files,
this was meant as an exercise to better understand PE file format.


# Build
```shell
$ build.bat
```
__Requirement__:
    nasm needs to be installed and in the PATH environment variable
